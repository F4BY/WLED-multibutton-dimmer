# WLED-multibutton-dimmer

Adding a second button (TTP223 Touch Module) to a ESP8266-12F in order to Change brightness and my most used effects with with 2 Touch Buttons.

This way I don't always have to take out my phone or bother my Alexa to toggle my 2 Fav. Effects aswell as brightness settings.
